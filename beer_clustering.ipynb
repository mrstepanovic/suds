    "## Beers Have Style\n",
    "Schwartzbier, real ale, wheat beer, KÃ¶lsch... many things can define a beer's style. In the professional brewing world, styles are typically differentiated by appearance, flavor, ingredients, production method, history, or origin. Unfortunately, not everyone agrees on how to categorize beer styles, and brewers often flip flop their beers between categories for competitions and distributors in different parts of the world. For instance, take a look at differences between CAMRA's Champion Beer of Britain, the Beer Judge Certification Program (BJCP), the Brewers Association's World Beer Cup). Furthermore, new styles are invented all the time as breweries try to differentiate their creations, and angsty beer geeks are given reason to wage sudsy wars in online forums.\n",
    "\n",
    "Meanwhile, back at the brewery, a brewer is mindfully formulating and testing beer according to precise scientific standards. This precision ensures that a Sierra Nevada Pale Ale tastes just as good no matter when or where you drink it. The subjective qualities of beer styles are transformed. Color is identified according to the Standard Reference Method (SRM), bitterness is quantified on the scale of International Bitterness Units (IBUs), and a beer's capacity for danger and fun is measured by its alcohol content (percentage of alcohol by volume, or ABV). Many other metrics exist, but these are the big three. Give a Certified Cicerone (beer sommelier) these three pieces of information, and he or she could likely tell you which style it belongs to before ever tasting it."
